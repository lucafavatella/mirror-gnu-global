At least, you had better search '[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]' for each version.

Version 4.8.1 - October 6 2004, by Shigio Yamaguchi

Fixed bugs:
* htags: The -d option of htags didn't work.
* htags: didn't recognize continued line and null directive(#).

New features:
* htags: make suffix list of include file configurable.
  (See man htags(1). config variables: include_file_suffixes)
* htags: try TMP if TMPDIR doesn't exist.(only DJGPP)
* htags: Warn about unknown preprocessing directive. As the exception,
  when unknown preprocessing directive appeared in assembly source,
  it will be recognized as the start of a shell comment.  
* htags: Add all yacc directives understood by bison-1.875.

Version 4.8 - August 26 2004, by Shigio Yamaguchi

* The htags(1) was rewritten in C language completely. It is compatible
  with the perl version and the performance has improved greatly.
  The perl version is left in the package for the time being as
  '/usr/local/bin/htags.pl' by default.
* htags: In PHP language, pickup variables in strings. ("${aaa}")
* gctags: Reserved word __thread added in C and C++.

Version 4.7.2 - June 7 2004, by Shigio Yamaguchi

Fixed bugs:
* Obsolete style of sort(1) still remained.

Version 4.7.1 - June 1 2004, by Shigio Yamaguchi

New features:
* Support home_etc(3) facility on PLD Linux/GNU.
* gctags: Pick up external defined functions as symbols.

Fixed bugs:
* GLOBAL doesn't work with the GNU sort(1) based on POSIX 1003.1-2001.
  The GNU sort(1) with the latest glibc doesn't accept obsolete
  +POS1[-POS2] style option.
* GLOBAL-4.3 and the later couldn't treat shadow tree.

Version 4.7 - Feb 1 2004, by Shigio Yamaguchi

* gtags.vim: Plugin script integrates GLOBAL with vim editor.
* global.txi: The usage of gtags.vim script added.
* global: The -o option becomes available with -P command.
* gctags: [bug fixed] Gctags couldn't recognize definitions in namespace block.
* Install gtags.conf and other files to $datadir/gtags.
* Borland C++ compiler support in Windows32 was finished because
  - Now, Cygwin environment is widely used.
  - Borland C++ compiler is not free software.

  The w32/ directory is leaved in this release but will be removed in the
  future release.

Version 4.6.1 - Oct 3 2003, by Shigio Yamaguchi

* gtags, htags, gctags: Added '.hpp' to the suffix list of C++ source file.

Version 4.6 - July 2 2003, by Shigio Yamaguchi

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
* The default value of the config variable 'definition_header' was changed
  to 'no', because the definition header is unsightly according to the place,
  especially in class definition.

[OTHER CHANGES]
* Added support for PHP language.
  (Known problems in htags)
  - The variable in string cannot be recognized.(global can recognize that.)
  - In HTML, the character string of the same spelling as the reserved
    word of PHP is recognized as a reserved word of PHP.
  I will rewrite htags in C language in the future to solve above problems.
* Added support for SCM_DEFINE macro which is part of guile-snarf.
* Added 'right' as a value of config variable 'definition_header'.
* Added some tool tips.
  - Alphabet in alphabetical index shows the count of definitions.
  - File name in file index show the full path name.
  - Anchor to duplicate index show the number of duplicated objects.
* Added .cvsrc,.cvsignore,.cvspass,.cvswrappers,autom4te.cache/
  to the default skip list.

Always thanks to Hideki Iwamoto san for his contribution.

Version 4.5.3 - June 5 2003, by Shigio Yamaguchi

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

* htags: Htags does not generate the code of javascript at all.
  In the former version, we used javascript to display information about
  links. But a browser these days had come to support the tool tip using
  'title' attribute. So, we replaced the function using tool tip instead
  of javascript facility.
* The --no-javascript option was removed because it was already unnecessary.
* global: The pattern of the argument came always to be interpreted
  as a extended regular expression. In the former version, there was both
  the case for the pattern to be interpreted as a basic regular expression
  and the interpretation as the extended regular expression. This depended
  on the environment of the build. (If you have grep(1) and xargs(1),
  basic regular expression will be used.)
  In the new version, if you want the pattern to be interpreted as a basic
  regular expression, please specify the -G option.

[OTHER CHANGES]

New features:

htags:
* CVS REPOSITORY link (the --cvsweb and --cvsweb-cvsroot option).
  You can link CVS repository from the hypertext of source code.
* Tooltip inserted in links.
* The --no-map-file option added.
  Htags generate 'MAP' file by default. You can suppress it by this.
* The --statistics option added.
  With this option, htags print statistics information to the standard error.

global:
* The -e(--regexp) option added like grep(1).
* The -G(--basic-regexp) option added like egrep(1).

Performance tuning:

htags:
* Remove tag name and line image from cache record. This made cache
  file smaller.
* The use of the temporary file was suppressed to the minimum by tring to
  read the source code.

Other modifications:

* A security hole was shut.
* conf.h: add '{arch}' and '.notfunction' to default skip list.
* gctags: support __attribute__((...)).

I wish to express my gratitude continuously since last time for the
contribution of Hideki Iwamoto san.

Version 4.5.2 - March 29 2003, by Shigio Yamaguchi

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

* htags: move title's '<H1>...</H1>' into configuration variables
  'title_begin' and 'title_end'. This makes configuration more flexible.
  If you are still using older version of gtags.conf, please replace it
  with one in this version.

  This indexes the places  where the header file is included.

  - add missing C++ reserved words asm,bool,const_cast,dynamic_cast,
    explicit,export,false,mutable,namespace,reinterpret_cast,static_cast,
    true,typeid,typename,using,wchar_t.
* htags: insert HTML tag in the line which was warned.
  (see configuration variable 'colorize_warned_line', 'warned_line_begin'
  and 'warned_line_end'.)
* gctags: pick up reference to macro in conditional directive.
* gctags: remove wchar_t from the reservation word list of C.
