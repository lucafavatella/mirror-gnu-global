			<<<CAUTION>>>

Borland C++ compiler support in Windows32 was finished because
  - Now, Cygwin environment is widely used.
  - Borland C++ compiler is not free software.

  The w32/ directory is leaved in this release but will be removed in the
  future release.

                ----------------------------------

Installation of GNU GLOBAL under Windows 32.

1. Required programs.

You need following programs to install and execute GLOBAL for Windows 32.

o Borland C++ compiler 5.0 or later.
	It may be downloaded at:
	http://community.borland.com/

o GNU sed and sort for Windows 32.
	It may be downloaded at:
	http://www.edv.agrar.tu-muenchen.de/~syring/win32/UnxUtils.html

o perl for Windows 32.
	It may be downloaded at Active STATE:
	http://www.activestate.com/


2. How to install.

Setup above programs and path for them then try this:

C:\global>xcopy /s w32\*.* .

(Edit makefile.inc if you need.)

C:\global>make		<- Invoke make.bat

C:\global>make install

C:\global>mkdir \tmp

C:\global>make clean


3. Some notes about GLOBAL for Windows 32.

Global requires the GNU programs sed.exe and sort.exe be the path.
Note that the sort that comes with Windows does not support multikey sorting
which is required by global. To avoid using that version of sort, the directory
containing the GNU version must be first in your PATH.

All paths are expected to use the UNIX directory separator '/' instead of
the DOS/Windows '\'. This includes the Global-specific environment variables
as well as paths given on command lines.  However, the path separators
expected for the PATH and GTAGSLIBPATH environment variables are expected
to be the DOS-style ';' instead of the UNIX-style ':'.

Global 4.0 has been tested under Windows NT 4.0 with Borland C++ 5.5.
