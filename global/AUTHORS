		----------------------------------

The GLOBAL was written by Shigio Yamaguchi.

Port to Windows 32 (for Borland C++ Compiler) by Dan Fandrich.
(w32/INSTALL, w32/machine/unistd.h and most of #ifdef _WIN32.)

Port to DJGPP by Jason Hood.
(libutil/is_unixy.[ch] and most of #ifdef __DJGPP__.)

INCLUDED FROM index of htags by Hideki IWAMOTO.
Besides he has contributed many improvements to htags and gctags.

There are also many others who have contributed patches and fixes.
Please see files ChangeLog and THANKS.

Note: GLOBAL is distributed with the files:

(GNU C Library)
regex.c, regex.h, snprintf.c, getopt.c, getopt1.c and getopt.h
(BSD DB Library)
bt_close.c, bt_open.c, bt_seq.c, db.c, queue.h, bt_conv.c, bt_overflow.c,
bt_split.c, db.h bt_debug.c, bt_page.c, bt_utils.c, extern.h bt_delete.c,
bt_put.c, btree.h, mpool.c bt_get.c, bt_search.c, compat.h, mpool.h

they are considered a separate package, not part of GLOBAL proper.
