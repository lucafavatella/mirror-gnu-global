Frequentry Asked Questions about GLOBAL.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. Does GLOBAL support DOS and Windows 32 environment?

A1. No, it doesn't. GNU GLOBAL supports only UNIX(POSIX) environment.
    But some outsite projects develop DOS and Windows 32 version of it.
    Please see:
           http://www.gnu.org/software/global/download.html

    Though GLOBAL doesn't supports DOS and Windows 32 environment,
    we accept the code for them if the following requirements are met:
    o It works in DOS and(or) Windows 32 environment.
    o It doesn't influence UNIX environment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2. GLOBAL skips some functions.
    For example, GLOBAL skips the function 'func()' in this example.

	#define M(a)	static char *string = a;

	M(a)

	func() {		<= GLOBAL skip func().
		...
	}

A2. GLOBAL cannot recognize 'func()', because M(a) seems to be a function
    definition.

    It should be follows:

	#define M(a)	static char *string = a

	M(a);			<= end with ';'

	func() {
		...
	}

    Otherwise, you can tell gtags(1) that 'M' is not a function by listing
    the macros in '.notfunction' file in the current directory.

	[.notfunction]
	+---------------
	|M
	|...

Q6. It seems that gtags(1) cannot treat files which include blanks in the path.
    Why?

A6. Because it is hard for GLOBAL to treat them correctly with keeping
    upper compatibility. Gtags(1) currently ignores files which include
    blanks in the path. We put the improvement to our TODO list but
    the priority is not high. The best way is not to use blanks in path name.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q7. Gtags(1) and htags(1) work only for one directory tree. So, we cannot
    refer library functions like strlen() from my project. Any solutions?

A7. For global(1), you can use GTAGSLIBPATH environment variable.

	[library]	/usr/src/lib
	[your project]	/usr/home/project

	$ (cd /usr/src/lib; gtags)
	$ export GTAGSLIBPATH=/usr/src/lib
	$ global strlen
	../../../usr/src/lib/libc/string/strlen.c

    For htags(1), you can merge library directories into your source project
    by copying them.
    For example:

	$ cd /usr/home/project
	$ cp -r /usr/src/lib .
	$ gtags
	$ htags

Q10. Does GLOBAL support multi-byte code set?
     Which character code set is supported?

A10. GLOBAL doesn't support multi-byte character code set yet.
     GLOBAL supports only ASCII and ASCII supersets.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q11. Can GLOBAL running on a UNIX machine treat source files
     which include DOS/Windows style new-line code? And vice versa? 

A11. GLOBAL support only the native text format.
     Besides, please go by the own responsibility.
