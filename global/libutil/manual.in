@HEADER	GTAGS.CONF,5,Nov 2015,GNU Project
@NAME	gtags.conf - configuration data for GNU GLOBAL
@SYNOPSIS
	@file{gtags.conf}
	@file{~/.globalrc}
@DESCRIPTION
	@file{gtags.conf} has configuration data for @xref{global,1}, @xref{gozilla,1},
	@xref{gtags,1} and @xref{htags,1}. They look for the following files in this order,
	and read from the first one that exists and is readable.
	@begin_verbatim
	(1) --gtagsconf @arg{file}
	(2) $GTAGSCONF
	(3) [project root]/gtags.conf
	(4) $HOME/.globalrc
	(5) /etc/gtags.conf
	(6) [sysconfdir]/gtags.conf
	@end_verbatim

	The format is almost similar to @xref{termcap,5} except for some extensions described
	later.
	The file includes one or more records; you should select a record using a label.
	Default label is 'default'. If @var{GTAGSLABEL} is set, its value is used. Please be
	aware of the meaning of 'default' it is different from one of @xref{termcap,5}.

	Lines starting with '#' are ignored.
	A record consists of one or more fields sepalated by ':' and ends with a newline.
	The first field must have a label name. Each field of the rest has a variable definition.
	There are three types in those variables.
	(1) boolean: This type has no value; existence of variable means true else false.
	(2) number: This type has a number value after '#'.
	(3) string: This type has a string value after '='.
	Most variables are relevant to string type.

	If data includes ':' or newline, you need quote it by '\\'.
	An empty field is permitted, but it doesn't make sense.

@Variable substitution
	Variable substitution similar to @xref{sh,1} is available.
	You can refer any string variable using '$' prefix. For example, the following
	@var{b} has a value 'XYZ'.
	@begin_verbatim
	:a=Y:b=X${a}Z:
	@end_verbatim
@Including another record
	@name{Tc} is a special variable; it read in definitions in another record.
	It is similar to the @name{tc} of @xref{termcap,5}.
	Syntax is as follows:
	@begin_verbatim
	tc=@var{label}[@@var{file}]
	@end_verbatim
	If only a label is given, @name{tc} read from a record specified by the label
	in the same file. If '@file' is also given, @name{tc} read from a record
	specified by the label in the specified file.
	Different from @xref{termcap,5}, you can use @name{tc} anytime anywhere.
@CONFIGURATION
	About variables for each command, please see each manual.

	You can use the following environment variables as a string variable.
	If these variables are set then environment variables of the same name are set before
	command execution.
	@begin_verbatim
	@var{GREP_COLOR}
	@var{GREP_COLORS}
	@var{GTAGSBLANKENCODE}
	@var{GTAGSCACHE}
	@var{GTAGSFORCECPP}
	@var{GTAGSGLOBAL}
	@var{GTAGSGTAGS}
	@var{GTAGSLIBPATH}
	@var{GTAGSLOGGING}
	@var{GTAGSTHROUGH}
	@var{GTAGS_OPTIONS}
	@var{HTAGS_OPTIONS}
	@var{MAKEOBJDIR}
	@var{MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX}
	@var{TMPDIR}
	@end_verbatim

	The following variables are also available as a string variable.
	By default, each of them has a directory path given by the configure
	script.
	@begin_verbatim
	@var{bindir}
        @var{datadir}
        @var{libdir}
        @var{localstatedir}
        @var{sysconfdir}
	@end_verbatim
@ENVIRONMENT
	The following environment variables affect the execution of the commands.

	@begin_itemize
	@item{@var{GTAGSCONF}}
		If this variable is set, the value is used as a configuration file.
	@item{@var{GTAGSLABEL}}
		If this variable is set, the value is used as a label of the configuration file.
		The default is @arg{default}.
	@end_itemize
