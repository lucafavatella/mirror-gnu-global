@DESCRIPTION
	@name{Htags} makes hypertext from C, C++, Yacc and Java source code.

	In advance of using this command, you must execute
	@xref{gtags,1} from the root directory of the source tree.
	Then you can execute @name{htags} from the same place.
	@name{Htags} makes an @file{HTML} directory and generates hypertext in it.

	You can start browsing from @file{HTML/index.html}.
	Once the hypertext is generated, you can move it anywhere and browse it
	with any browser.
