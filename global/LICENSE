     To All Licensees, Distributors of Any Version of BSD:

     As you know, certain of the Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD") source
     code files require that further distributions of products containing all or
     portions of the software, acknowledge within their advertising materials
     that such products contain software developed by UC Berkeley and its
     contributors.

     Specifically, the provision reads:

     "     * 3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software
           *    must display the following acknowledgement:
           *    This product includes software developed by the University of
           *    California, Berkeley and its contributors."

     Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer required to
     include the acknowledgement within advertising materials.  Accordingly, the
     foregoing paragraph of those BSD Unix files containing it is hereby deleted
     in its entirety.
