                ----------------------------------

The gnusort is GNU sort itself.

GNU GLOBAL package includes gnusort in the package to avoid following
troubles:
o A certain operating system has another 'sort' command that specification
  is different from GNU sort. Unluckily, the command is often invoked
  for GLOBAL.
o Multi-language version of sort is often very slow. Since GLOBAL doesn't
  support multi-language, the slowness is quite meaningless.
o In the past, the specification of sort command was changed.

These files were derived from GNU textutil-2.0 and 2.1.

File name		Drived from
------------------------------------
xmalloc.c, xalloc.h	textutil-2.1
the rest		textutil-2.0

The usage of HAVE_DECL_XXX in sys2.h was fixed.
