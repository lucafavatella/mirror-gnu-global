		----------------------------------

Installation of GNU GLOBAL under UNIX, CYGWIN or DJGPP.

1. Preparation.

o If your environment is Windows32(Windows95,98,NT...), you need to
  install DJGPP or CYGWIN tools to your environment. See following site:

	CYGWIN: http://cygwin.com/
	DJGPP:  http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/

  You should install the following GNU tools and set the path so that they
  are invoked.

	gcc, bash

o If you want to format man files then nroff is needed.

   Additionally, if you setup man(1) on your system then you can use man
   command to read GLOBAL's online manuals.

o If you want to use the -I option of global(1) then id-utils(1) is needed.

   You can get id-utils at:

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/id-utils/
  
o If you want to use --form(-f) or --dynamic option of htags then
  PERL version 4 or later is needed.

   If you don't have it, you can fetch it from this site.

	http://www.perl.com/CPAN/

2. How to install.

   UNIX or CYGWIN:

	% ./configure
	% make
	# make install

   DJGPP:
	c:\> bash configure
	c:\> make
	c:\> make install

3. Using GLOBAL with editors.

o Nvi-1.79

   Please get nvi-1.79 at:

	   http://www.bostic.com/vi/

   and do the followings.

	% tar xzvf nvi-1.79.tar.gz
	% cd nvi-1.79
	% patch -p < nvi-1.79-gtags.diff
	% cd build
	% ./configure
	% make
	# make install

   ('nvi-1.79-gtags.diff' is included in GLOBAL package.)

o Nvi-1.81.5

   Please get nvi-1.81.5 at:


	   http://www.kotnet.org/~skimo/nvi/

   build it with '--enable-perlinterp' option and do the followings.
   ($HOME/perl is an example. Please replace it with any directory you like.)

	% mkdir $HOME/perl
	% cp gtags.pl $HOME/perl
	% vi $HOME/.nexrc
	+-----------------------------------------
	|perl use lib qw($ENV{HOME}/perl)
	|perl require 'gtags.pl'
	|map ^P :tagprev^M
	|map ^N :tagnext^M
	|map ^] :perl tag^M
	|ab gtag perl tag qw(
	|ab gta perl tag qw(
	|ab gt perl tag qw(

   ('gtags.pl' is included in GLOBAL package.)

o Emacs

   Global supports GNU Emacs and XEmacs. If you meet some troubles,
   please let me know.

   You can get them at:

	GNU emacs:
		ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/
	XEmacs:
		http://www.xemacs.org

   If you have installed it then copy gtags.el in this package to the emacs
   lisp library directory or place the file in a directory
   (for example "~/lisp") and write $HOME/.emacs like this.

	+-----------------------------------------------
	|(setq load-path (cons "~/lisp" load-path))

o Elvis

   You need Elvis 2.1 or later. You can get it at:

	http://www.fh-wedel.de/elvis/

   You need not any patch for it.

Good luck!
