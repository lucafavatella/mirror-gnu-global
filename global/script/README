Usage of server-side GLOBAL

If the following conditions are met, you can use GLOBAL's facilities
without installing GLOBAL in your machine.

1. You have a server machine in which GLOBAL is installed. 
2. You can log in the server without pass word using ssh.
3. You can access the same project in both your machine and the server
   by the same path name.
4. You can access to the scripts in the '/usr/local/share/gtags/script'
   in the server.

Though 3. and 4. assumed network file system like NFS, copying files is also OK.

How to use server-site GLOBAL.

1. Set the server name to 'GTAGSREMOTEHOST' environment variable. If your
   user id in the server is different from the local machine, set the user id
   to 'GTAGSREMOTEUSER'.  And you can use gtags-client, global-client and
   htags-client instead of gtags, global and htags respectively.

2. To use the various environments which GLOBAL supports, please set the
   following variables like follows:
	GTAGSGTAGS=gtags-client
	GTAGSGLOBAL=global-client
	LESSGLOBALTAGS=less-global	(if you use less)

	[$HOME/.elvisrc]		(if you use elvis)
	+----------------------------
	|set tagprg="elvis-global $1"

Good luck!
