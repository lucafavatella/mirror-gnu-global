Usage of server-side GLOBAL

If the following conditions are met, you can use GLOBAL's facilities
without installing GLOBAL in your machine.

o You have a server machine in which GLOBAL is installed. 
o You have to be able to log in the server without pass word using ssh.
o You have to be able to access the same project in both your machine
  and the server by the same path name. (maybe using network file system)

How to use server-site GLOBAL.

1. Copy some scripts in the /usr/local/share/gtags/script in the server
   to your machine and make them executable.

2. Set the server name to 'GTAGSREMOTEHOST' environment variable, and you can
   use gtags-client and global-client instead of gtags and global respectively.

3. To use the various environments which GLOBAL supports, please set the
   following variables like follows:
	GTAGSGTAGS=gtags-client
	GTAGSGLOBAL=global-client
	LESSGLOBALTAGS=less-global (if you use less)

Good luck!
