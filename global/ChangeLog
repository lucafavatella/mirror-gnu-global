ChangeLog about GNU GLOBAL

June 1 2004, Shigio Yamaguchi  <shigio@gnu.org>

	* htags: Function usable() was changed to the same specification
	  as usable() in libutil/usable().
	* htags: Execution path of global(1) was changed to the absolute path.
	* htags: Write FILEMAP file for reference from external system.
	* conf.c: New config variable 'bindir' and 'datadir' added.
	* w32/ directory removed.

Feb 1 2004, Shigio Yamaguchi  <shigio@gnu.org>

	* Rewrite strbuf_putn() without snprintf().
	* Created datadir, the default is '/usr/local/share/gtags'.
	  The following files are installed into the directory:
	  AUTHORS COPYING ChangeLog FAQ INSTALL LICENSE NEWS README THANKS
	  globash.rc gtags.conf gtags.el gtags.pl gtags.vim nvi-1.79-gtags.diff

Oct 3 2003, Shigio Yamaguchi  <shigio@gnu.org>

	* gtags.conf.in, libutil/conf.h.in: Now gtags.conf and conf.h
	  are generated by autoconf.
	* The priority of the method of directory traverse was reversed again,
	  because, in some GNU/Linux, struct dirent has a member d_type but
	  always return 0. As the result, if find(1) is available then use it,
	  otherwise use dirent(3).

July 2 2003, Shigio Yamaguchi  <shigio@gnu.org>

	* gctags: If you want to build this parser from original source in
	  CVS repository then it is necessary to install flex(1) and gperf(1)
	  in your environment. (Since both of them are GNU software,
	  you can get them from GNU ftp site.)
	* reserved.pl: Generate C and Perl code for locating reserved words.
	* gtags.c: The --createdb and the --readdb option which used for anchor
	  database were removed, becase there is no necessity any longer.

June 5 2003, Shigio Yamaguchi  <shigio@gnu.org>

	* libutil/env.c: replace putenv() and setenv() with set_env();
	* libutil/char.c,char.h: New files.
	* libutil/find.c: Skip symbolic links to eliminate the difference
	  between find(1) version and dirent(3) version.
	* htags.in: Remove tag name and line image from cache record.
	  This made cache file smaller.
	* htags.in: Stop using anchor db. Up to now, only gtags had called
	  the parser. But hereafter, the parser will be called by both
	  gtags and htags.
	* global.c: About the -g option, implementation using grep + xargs
	  was removed.
	* libutil/find.c: The priority of the method of directory traverse
	  was reversed. If dirent(3) is available, then use it to traverse
	  directory tree. Otherwise use find(1).
	* configure.ac: --with-cflags=[=VAL] was removed.
	  Please use ./configure CFLAGS=VAL instead.
	* reconf.sh: --configure, --make and --install option added.

March 29 2003, Shigio Yamaguchi  <shigio@gnu.org>

	* C.c,Cpp.c: move some code into condition_macro.
	* C.h, Cpp.h, java.h: replace #define macro with enum member
	  for representing reserved words.
	* htags.in: add reserved words.
	* htags/manual.in: add description about configuration variable
	  'table_begin' and 'tabel_end'.
	* htags.in, manual.in: add configuration variables
	  'colorize_warned_line', 'warned_line_begin', 'warned_line_end'.
	* dbop.c: environment variable GTAGSCACHE added.

	* configure.ac: fixed for autoconf-2.53 and renamed.
	* acconfig.h: removed because it is considered to be obsoleted.
	* gctags: inittable() added for each parser, which set up reserved
	  word table.
	* doc/*.texi: renamed from *.texi to *.txi for djgpp.
	* libutil: linetable.[ch] added.

July 4 2002, Shigio Yamaguchi  <shigio@gnu.org>

	* gctags.c: allows second argument in *ENTRY for 4.3BSD.
	* split.c: splitting function added.
	* strlimcpy.c: replaced strcpy() and strncpy() with strlimcpy().
	* strbuf.c: strbuf_putn() added.

	* usable.c: locate command for BINDIR before PATH.
	* htags: bless.sh remove cgi-bin/global.cgi because it is not needed.
	* htags: changed open into 'open + exec' to avoid command substitutions
	  in pattern.

	  David Aspinwall ported Global-3.44 into cygwin32 environment.
