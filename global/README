		----------------------------------

GNU GLOBAL is a source code tag system that works the same way across diverse
environments. It supports C, C++, Yacc and Java source code.

* Installation

	If you use a UNIX or DJGPP on Windows9X then please see 'INSTALL'.
	If you want to use Borland C++ compiler on Windows32 environment
	then please see 'w32/INSTALL'.

	Note: I strongly recommend you to use UNIX(GNU/Linux,*BSD) environment.
	I cannot say GLOBAL works well in Windows32 environment because
	I don't use it and in fact I don't have it.

* Documentation

	Please see 'doc/global.texi'(texinfo format) to know how to use GLOBAL.
	The real GLOBAL documentation is incomplete, and will be revised.
	The descriptions about new facilities are added to 'NEWS'.  At least,
	you had better read '[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]' for each version.

* License

	You may redistribute copies of GNU GLOBAL under the terms of
	the GNU General Public License.
	For more information about these matters, see the files named COPYING.

* Latest information

	You can see the latest information on GLOBAL's WWW.

	in GLOBAL or you need help about GLOBAL, then some mailing lists are
